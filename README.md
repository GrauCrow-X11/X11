### X11 is a Personal Portfolio Project & Practice | Discipline Guides Achievement

# Current Goals For This Project

1. Provide More Content.
2. Reduce recurring code, purge unused code, and produce a smaller overall package.
3. Build from the HTML and CSS foundations, while continuing to implement JavaScript.

## Important Information Pertaining to Structure and Tag Naming

1. Within styles.css there are both tag and symbol markdown methodology.

    - ```! = Global/Parent Element```
    - ```? = Child Element```
    - ```* = Explanation of Code```
        - ```an = about-nested | A nested grid within the About Page's Main Grid```
        - ```pn = portfolio-nested | A nested grid within the Portfolio's Main Grid```

## Each Page Represents Something I Can Offer

1. ```index.html``` / **Home**

    - Within this page, you'll be greeted with a straight forward introduction of myself. Content is still a work in progress.

2. ```about.html``` / **About**

    - Within this page, you'll be introduced to who I am, what can I offer, what are my skills, and even future goals and aspirations. Content is still a work in progress.

3. ```portfolio.html``` / **Portfolio**

    - Within this page, you'll find some of the work I've done/or currently working on. Past & Present Projects are listed here. Content is still a work in progress.

4. ```contact.html``` / **Contact**

    - Within this page, you'll find a way to contact me, if you have any inquires. Content is still a work in progress.
